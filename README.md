Mommy wants to watch RaiPlay on her TV, but the stream is only available in Italy.
A VPN is a hassle on tvOS, so I wrote this. Goal is to make it as simple to use as possible.

Still only works in italy. Have to try and bypass that another way.
Try a proxy?

# Usage

1. Install the Stremio app on your Apple TV
2. Open the app and go to the addons section
3. Add a new addon with the URL `http://<ip>:<port>`
4. Failure. // Enjoy RaiPlay
